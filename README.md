## Hi there I am Kavan KansodariyaðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m a pre-final year student at the Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology, Gandhinagar, pursuing my undergraduate degree in Information and Communication Technology.

I love reading both fiction and non-fiction books. One quote from The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People that resonates with me is:

"It is the weak who are cruel,gentleness can only be expected from the strong."
â€” Leo Roskin
